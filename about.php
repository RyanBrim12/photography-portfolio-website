        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ryan Brim. I am a student at the University of Vermont and I am pursuing a degree in computer science. As long as I can remember I have been taking pictures. Before anything else I remember playing with disposable cameras and taking pictures of anything I thought was interesting. Then, my parents got me an iPod Touch. With this iPod, now  I was able to take all of the pictures that I wanted. I carried my iPod with me at all times and pulled it out whenever I saw something interesting. These pictures were often really bad, because I did not know anything about the elements of art or the principles of design. I had no clue about what the rule of thirds was or how to properly frame a photo. I made up for my lack of knowledge with pure enthusiasm. But as I went on, I wanted to take better photos.

            I owe much of the knowledge that I have gained about photography since then to my dad. My dad is a semi-professional photographer. He started with photography as a hobby and as he did it more he became more interested and passionate. He took courses and learned as much as he could and he passed his knowledge on to me. Whenever I took a picture that I was proud of, I would show it to him and he would critique it and explain photography ideas that would make it even better. I was always so excited to show him my pictures because it meant I would learn more.

            My journey in learning photography has not been very straightforward or short. I have been taking pictures and slowly improving my entire life.  Iâ€™m sure that I will continue to learn more about photography as I continue taking them.
