        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, welcome to my online photography portfolio. This website was created as my final project for cs008 Introduction to Web Site Development. This site is a portfolio of many of my favorite photos that I have taken. These photos are taken in very different styles and there are many different types of photos. Some of the types of photos on this site are landscapes, nature, architecture, portraits, and sports.

            Landscapes and nature photography are some of my favorite kinds of photos to take. This is because they are of things that exist without me. I dislike studio photography because it feels manufactured. I prefer to take pictures of things the way that they are. I do not want to stage pictures, I want  to show them the way that they naturally are. Landscape photography is very interesting because there is nothing you can really do to stage it. You can not pose mountains or trees, all you can do is frame them. Nature photography is also interesting for the same reasons. Animals do not care that you want to take a picture of them, they are going to do what they want to do. This means that in order to capture them you must work with them and put yourself where they want you to be.

            My approach to photography likely comes from the fact that I take most of my photos on my phone. I donâ€™t usually go out with the intention of taking photos, I go about my normal life and when I see something that could be a good picture I stop and take it.
